## Inspiration
We drew our inspiration from our own personal experience at MLH! As part of an international program, we were paired with accomplished developers from around the world. Seeing the incredible diversity in our very own program, we wanted to create an opportunity for others to see how wide-spread the employees and members of their organizations are. GeoClusion celebrates the differences in our cultures, and delights in the similarities that bring us together.

## What it does
Geoclusion allows organizations to demonstrate their inclusion culture, while encouraging connections between like-minded members. Organizations sign up for a unique id, which they provide to their members to create personal profiles. Members can customize their profiles with their geographic data, food preferences and various hobbies. Other users can then connect with fellow organization members from across the globe using an interactive map.  Users can find a new hiking buddy, or organize meetups with members in their area.
